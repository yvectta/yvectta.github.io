<span style="font-size: 24px;">**About**</span>

I am currently pursuing an MS in Biostatistics at the [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/) Mailman School of Public Health, with a concentration in Theory and Methods. Prior to this, I earned a BS in Statistics from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en) in 2024. I have worked on projects involving both medical and financial data, and I am eager to explore more medical-related topics in the future.
